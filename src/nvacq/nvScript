# NetworkDisk_BasePath - if NULL then the bit and exec files are loaded from flash
#                      Otherwise used as the directory on the network drive to load from.
#  e.g. NetworkDisk_BasePath = /tftpboot    /tftpboot/xxxexec.o are loaded
#
#       systemInit("/tftpboot",0,1,0,0)  load bit and exec.o from /tftpboot
#
# BringUp_Level - level of software service, etc.  started
#    0 = only dma drivers initialized.
#    1 = DMA, NDDS, initialized
#        Bringup is called.
#    2-9 Reserved for future use.
