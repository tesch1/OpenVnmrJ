peak2d:$maximum,$trace,$point -	return information about maximum in 2D data
peak2d(f2_highfield,f2_lowfield,f1_highfield,f1_lowfield):$maximum,$f2_freq,$f1_freq -	return information about maximum in 2D data
*******************************************************************************

  "peak2d" searches the area defined by "sp","wp","sp1" and "wp1" in a
2D data set for a maximum. It returns the maximum intensity found in the
first return variable. If a second return variable is defined, it returns
the trace number in that variable. The variable "trace" defines, whether
"f1" or "f2" traces are counted. If a third return variable is defined,
it returns the data point number of the maximum on that trace.

The second form of the peak2d commands takes four arguments defining the
area within which to search for the maximum. It returns the maximum intensity
in the first return value. The maximum is scaled by the vs2d parameter. It may
be either a positive or negative maximum. The second and third return
arguments contain the F2 and F1 frequencies of the maximum point.

Examples

peak2d(sp,sp+wp,sp1,sp1+wp1):$max,cr,cr1

finds the maximum in the currently display region and sets the cursors to that
position.

peak2d(cr-delta,cr,cr1-delta1,cr1):$max,$f2frq,$f1frq

finds the maximum in the region enclosed by the cursors
